# 🛠️ Web.sh — A Powerful PHP Development Environment

`web.sh` is a powerful and developer-friendly shell utility designed to streamline local development of PHP applications using Docker. It offers built-in support for **WordPress**, **Laravel**, and more, with automatic setup of SSL certificates, host redirection, Docker services, and supervisor configuration — all from a single command-line tool.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📦 **Dockerized environment** for PHP, MariaDB, Redis, Caddy, PhpMyAdmin, and Mailhog
* ⚡ **Quick WordPress/Laravel setup** with SSL and database
* 🛡️ **Automatic root and site-specific SSL certificate generation**
* 🌐 **Local domain redirection** (`/etc/hosts` or Windows-compatible)
* 🐠 **Fish shell** completions and environment
* 🔧 **Supervisor** support for Laravel Horizon
* 📥 **Chrome Root CA import** support
* 📚 JSON-based host configuration (`web-hosts.json`)
* 🛠️ Developer-focused tools and utilities built-in

## ⚙️ Installation

```sh
web install
```

This creates symlinks:

* `~/.local/bin/web` → CLI utility
* `~/.config/fish/completions/web.fish` → Fish shell completion

---

## 📌 Usage Overview

Run the following to see all available options:

```sh
web
```

### 🆕 Add a New Host

```sh
web new-host example.test -t wp        # WordPress
web new-host project.local -t laravel  # Laravel
```

This will:

* Download and install the framework
* Generate SSL certificates
* Add host entries
* Create and configure databases
* Build Caddy configs and restart services

## 🔐 SSL & Security

* Root CA is generated via `web rootssl`
* Host SSL certificates are issued with `web hostssl <host>`
* SSL certs are stored in: `php/config/ssl`
* Use `web import-rootca` to trust the CA in **Chrome/Linux** environments

---

## 🛑 Removing a Host

```sh
web remove-host example.test
```

This will:

* Remove project files
* Drop database and user
* Remove SSL certs and redirect entry
* Regenerate Caddy configs

---

## 🔍 Advanced

### 🧪 Enable Xdebug

```sh
web debug debug     # Enable
web debug off       # Disable
```

### 📡 Supervisor for Laravel Horizon

```sh
web supervisor-conf mysite.test
web restart-supervisor
```
